# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my complete Neovim setup, optimized for programming, system administration, and cybersecurity tasks. It includes plugins and settings to enhance productivity, navigation, and code clarity.

## Features

- **Plugin Management**: Utilizes [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) to manage all plugins.

  - [vim-vsnip](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-vsnip) and [cmp-vsnip](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-vsnip): Snippet support.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) for advanced syntax highlighting and code structure parsing.
- **Indentation Visualization**: [indent-blankline.nvim](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim) to display indentation levels.
- **Theme**: [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/vim) for a visually appealing dark interface.
